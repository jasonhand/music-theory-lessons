## üìñ Educational Philosophy

This application is built on the principle that **music theory should enhance creativity, not restrict it**. By providing interactive tools and visual representations, learners can:

- **Experiment safely** with different musical concepts
- **See patterns** that might not be obvious in traditional notation
- **Make connections** between different theoretical concepts
- **Learn at their own pace** without pressure
